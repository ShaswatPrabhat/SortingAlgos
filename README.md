Sorting Algorithms in Python

## Insertion Sort

In Place sorting which runs through the elements and then finds the correct place for each element by shifting all
elements more than the element. This way running from first element to last we are able to find correct index for each
element iteratively.

Time complexity: O(n^2)

Space complexity: O(1)

In-Place: Yes

Boundary Cases: Insertion sort takes maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order. 
And it takes minimum
time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
